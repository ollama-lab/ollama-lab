# Ollama Lab 😮🦙⚗️

> Ollama Lab is currently under pre-alpha phase. The features are incomplete.

Yet another (unofficial) [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) GUI but based on [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
We make Ollama easy-to-use for everyone.

## Features 🌟

- 🤖 Manage, install, and uninstall LLMs
- 👩‍🍳 Easy to use. Designed for everyone, not exclusively for professionals.
- 🈚 Free and open source! Everyone can use and change without any marketing concerns!
