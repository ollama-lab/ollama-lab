# Ollama Lab

Yet another [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) GUI but based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
We make Ollama easy-to-use for everyone.

## Features 🌟

- 💬 Chat with LLMs (obviously!)
- 💾 Manage your chat history (locally)
- 🤖 Manage, install, and uninstall LLMs
- 👩‍🍳 Easy to use. Designed for everyone, not exclusively for professionals.
- 🈚 Free and open source! Everyone can use and change without any marketing concerns!

## Why named after Ollama?

Ollama Lab is designed to focus on working seamlessly and smoothly with Ollama,
rather than being a generic chatbot UI supporting multiple different LLM runtime platforms.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ollama Lab is NOT affiliated to or part of the Ollama project.
