Yet another (unofficial) [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) GUI but based on [Tauri](https://tauri.app) and [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/).
We make Ollama easy-to-use for everyone.

## Install

### Use installers

Find out an installer for your system on our [release page](https://github.com/chardoncs/ollama-lab/releases).

### Use package managers

#### Arch Linux

Ollama Lab is currently not in the official package index.
Use one of our AURs ([`ollama-lab`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ollama-lab) or [`ollama-lab-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ollama-lab-bin)) to install Ollama Lab.

Or you can use an AUR helper:

```bash
# yay
yay -S ollama-lab
# OR paru
paru -S ollama-lab
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> It is recommended to run `yay/paru -Scc` to clean up the space after using `ollama-lab`,
> because the build files may take up to 8~10 GiB on your disks.
