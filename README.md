# Ollama Lab

Yet another [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) GUI but based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
We make Ollama easy-to-use for everyone.

## Features 🌟

- Chat with LLMs 💬 (obviously!)
- Manage, install, and uninstall LLMs 🤖
- Easy to use 👩‍🍳 Designed for everyone, not exclusively for professionals.
- Free and open source! 🈚 Everyone can use and change without any marketing concerns!

## Why named after Ollama?

Ollama Lab is designed to focus on working seamlessly and smoothly with Ollama,
rather than being a generic chatbot UI supporting multiple different LLM runtime platforms.

> [!NOTE]

> Ollama Lab is NOT affiliated to or part of the Ollama project.
